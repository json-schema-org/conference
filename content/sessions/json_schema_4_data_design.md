As modern relational databases increasingly support JSON, it’s time to explore how JSON Schema can enhance database operations. In this talk, we’ll dive into the newly developed 'Database Vocabulary', authored by Oracle and a proposal to the official JSON Schema specification. This vocabulary addresses key database tasks, including validation, type coercion, and metadata preservation, making it easier to manage JSON in databases effectively.

With Oracle's latest release, 23ai, fully implementing this vocabulary, attendees will not only learn the concepts but also see real-world demos of JSON Schema validation in action and how to describe database objects in JSON Schema. Whether you’re managing large-scale databases or building database-driven apps, this session will equip you with practical tools to streamline your workflows.
