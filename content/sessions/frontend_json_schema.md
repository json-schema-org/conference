As applications become increasingly complex, the demand for adaptable user interfaces grows ever more critical. In the Jupyter ecosystem, where users often require unique configurations tailored to their specific needs, the traditional approach to frontend development can be cumbersome and labor-intensive. Each custom configuration typically entails significant effort in both implementation and ongoing maintenance. In this talk, we will share how we leveraged JSON Schema to create a flexible frontend capable of accommodating multiple custom use cases and configurations seamlessly. By using JSON Schema as a foundation, we were able to streamline the generation of dynamic forms and validation processes, significantly reducing development time and simplifying maintenance. Attendees will learn about our approach, the benefits of a schema-driven architecture, and practical insights that can be applied to enhance their own frontend solutions in Jupyter and beyond
