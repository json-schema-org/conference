We are looking for a Sponsor to help us cover the expenses of travel and accomodation as well as support speakers with a speaker stipend to make it easier for them to come.

This is an amazing opportunity to support the Community. To know more about how to sponsor please check [the conference's page in our Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/json-schema/events/the-json-schema-conference-f259215b).
